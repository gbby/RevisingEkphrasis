# Description

*Revising Ekphrasis* is a collaborative visualization project that came about through the 2016 [Humanities Data Visualization](http://humanitiesvis.lmc.gatech.edu/) workshop held at Georgia Tech. It builds on [research](http://www.lisarhody.com/revising-ekphrasis/) conducted by one of our group members, Lisa Rhody, that theorizes how the genre of contemporary ekphrastic poetry operates, and contributes to a broad dialogue around how scholars might use humanities questions and concerns to guide information visualization (and vice versa).
